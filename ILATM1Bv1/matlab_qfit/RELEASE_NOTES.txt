Matlab ILATM1B Reader Release Notes 2013-05-14

Fixed bug in readILATM1B.m first reported by Ben Panzer at CReSIS such that
the program would return different sized arrays on subsequent calls using
the same input file. Ben suggested removing the & from the unix() call to
qi2txt so that readILATM1B.m waits for qi2txt to finish processing before
readILATM1B.m reads the output file produced by qi2txt. Implemented Ben's
suggestion.

Added returned header value.

Added use of Matlab tempname function in place of hard-coded temporary
file names.

Added creation and display of version string.

Removed example_output_readILATM1B.txt and created test_readILATM1B.m
and associated expected_output.txt which is a link to
../C/example_output.txt.

Added make_tarball.pl.

Added matlab_ILATM1B_reader_0.2.tar.

Added RELEASE_NOTES.txt
